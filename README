I thank Moses Schönfinkel, who in 1924 wrote a paper titled "On the building
blocks of mathematical logic".  I found this paper in "From Frege to Gödel, A
Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931".

Mr. Schönfinkel observes that all computable functions can be defined in terms
of just two primitive functions C and S applied together in various
combinations.  This is a profound and magnificent insight for which I am very
grateful.

The C function is governed by the rule ((C x) y) = x.  This is known as the
"constancy function", or "Konstanzfunktion" in the original German.

The S function is governed by the rule (((S x) y) z) = ((x z) (y z)).  This is
known as the "fusion function", or "Verschmelzungfunktion" in the original
German.

I also thank Jørgen Steensgaard-Madsen, who in 1989 wrote a paper titled
"Typed Representation of Objects by Functions".  I found this paper in the
"ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, January 1989, Volume
11 Number 1".

Mr. Steensgaard-Madsen observes that all of what we ordinarily understand as
"data" can be represented as pure functions.  Even a piece of data as humble
as a single bit is in essence just a function.
