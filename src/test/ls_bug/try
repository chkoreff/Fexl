# NOTE: There's a bug in ls on many Linux systems I have tried.  As it turns
# out, there's also a corresponding bug in sort.
#
# You can run this test script as "./try".  When the bugs are fixed, there
# should be no output.
#
# The man page says:
# "Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified."
#
# Consequently if I run "ls -1 dir" I would expect the entries to be sorted
# alphabetically.  However, on my machine I see this output:
#
# read_csv.fxl
# read.fxl
# read_ssv.fxl
#
# Clearly the "read.fxl" should appear first because '.' is less than '_'.  So
# ls is not strictly doing what the man page says above.  The "read.fxl" is out
# of order.
#
# Note that even piping the output through "sort" does not correct the order,
# which implies a deeper problem in a library.  Indeed, when I reported this
# finding to the PopOS maintainers at System76, they replied:
#
# "I notified the Pop!_OS maintainers. They let me know that we are using GNU
# coreutils 8.13.  We will be changing to 9.xx soon.  I showed them the bug,
# and they were just as excited as I was about it.  Such a strange bug, but
# also I commend you for having the keen eye to catch something like this."

# NOTE 20240229 I researched GNU coreutils and found this explanaton:
# https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/faq/coreutils-faq.html#Sort-does-not-sort-in-normal-order_0021

# The next line is the fix they give:
export LC_ALL=C

# Try ls by itself.
ls -1 dir | diff - correct

# Try ls with sort.
ls -1 dir | sort | diff - correct
