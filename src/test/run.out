"Ain't nothin' simple when you're doin' it for real." (Gus Baird)

"My fathers sleep on the sunrise plains,
And each one sleeps alone.
Their trails may dim to the grass and rains,
For I choose to make my own.
I lay proud claim to their blood and name,
But I lean on no dead kin;
My name is mine, for the praise or scorn,
And the world began when I was born
And the world is mine to win. ..."

  (Badger Clark, "The Westerner")
